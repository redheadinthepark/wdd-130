        <div id="river1-info">
            <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river and never left.</p>
            <p>Elk and deer graze on the hillsides, and bear and bighorn sheep are commonly sighted. The river corridor is lined with awe-inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy campsites, providing shelter from sun or rain.</p>
            <p>The rapids are class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the US. The water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. Families with children tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

        <div id="river2-info">
            <p>Winding through canyons in Central Utah, in some of the most desolate lands anywhere, the Green River flows towards the mighty Colorado River and the ocean. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River, Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>
            <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually traveled in 6 exciting days.</p>
            <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on its uniqueness, and thr rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

        <div id="river3-info">
            <p>This is the grand-daddy of all canyons and the grand_daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.</p>
            <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and views of ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.</p>
            <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
