    <h2>Leah Adair</h2>
    <p>I'm almost done with a bachelor's in University Studies and a minor in Web Design.</p>
    <p>Coding and programming have intimidated me in the past, but I've been enjoying this class so far.</p>
    <p>I love to spend time with my family doing a variety of things, most recently visiting and hiking in Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, USA.</p> 
    <p>My whole family was able to go together. I am married with 3 children, one of which is married so I have gained another daughter.</p>
    <p>Our youngest is preparing to serve a mission right now.</p>
    <p>I feel very grateful and blessed to be able to get my degree online from BYUI. I think it is a great school, and I have learned a lot over the last few years.</p>
